   <h2>Advantages of Artificial Intelligence</h2> 
   <h3>1. Reduction in Human Error</h3>
   One of the biggest advantages of AI is that it can significantly reduce errors and <br>
   increase accuracy and precision. The decisions taken by AI in every step is <br>
   decided by information previously gathered and a certain set of algorithms. When 
   <br>programmed properly, these errors can be reduced to null. 
   <h3>2. Zero Risks</h3>
   
Another big advantage of AI is that humans can overcome many risks by letting AI <br>
robots do them for us. Whether it be defusing a bomb, going to space, exploring <br>
the deepest parts of oceans, machines with metal bodies are resistant in nature <br>and can survive unfriendly atmospheres. Moreover, they can provide accurate <br>work with greater responsibility and not wear out easily.<br>

   <h3>3. New Inventions</h3>
   
AI has helped in coming up with new inventions in almost every domain to solve<br> complex problems. A recent invention has helped doctors to predict early stages of <br>breast cancer in women using advanced AI-based technologies.<br> <br>

   <h2>Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
   <h3>1. High Costs</h3>
   The ability to create a machine that can simulate human intelligence is no small feat. It requires plenty <br>
   of time and resources and can cost a huge deal of money. AI also needs to operate on the latest <br>
   hardware and software to stay updated and meet the latest requirements, thus making it quite costly.<br>
   <h3>2. Make Humans Lazy</h3>
   
   AI applications automate the majority of tedious and repetitive tasks. Since we do not have to<br>
   memorize things or solve puzzles to get the job done, we tend to use our brains less and less.<br>
   This addiction to AI can cause problems to future generations.
   <h3>3. No Ethics</h3>
   Ethics and morality are important human features that can be difficult to incorporate into an AI. The <br>
   rapid progress of AI has raised a number of concerns that one day, AI will grow uncontrollably, and<br>
   eventually wipe out humanity. This moment is referred to as the AI singularity.
