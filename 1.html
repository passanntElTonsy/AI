    The idea of inanimate objects coming to life as intelligent beings has been<br>
    around for a long time. The ancient Greeks had myths about robots, and<br>
    Chinese and Egyptian engineers built automatons.<br>
    The beginnings of modern AI can be traced to classical philosophers' attempts to<br>
    describe human thinking as a symbolic system. But the field of AI wasn't formally<br>
    founded until 1956, at a conference at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New <br>
    Hampshire, where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined.
